    <p>
        Wizard hosts Multiple Steps, user can click on next or back button. Each step is hosted within a viewTemplate, which contains multiple children. Each child can contain <span class="inlineCode">atom-next</span> property which can hold an action set to be invoked on click of next button. If <span class="inlineCode">atom-next</span> is not set, wizard will automatically jump to next step.</p>
    <p>
        In example above, first two steps actually try to post data to http server, and if the post was successful, then form&#39;s <span class="inlineCode">atom-next</span> is set to <span class="inlineCode">goNextCommand</span> which will advance wizard to next step.</p>
