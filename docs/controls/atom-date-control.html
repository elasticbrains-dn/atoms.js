    <h1>AtomDateControl</h1>
    <p>This control is simple, old style, three drop down for Year, Month and Day for selecting Date. Calendar style date controls are little complicated to choose for longer year range. But this is still the most simple way to choose date yet.</p>
    <p>Value property of AtomDateControl accepts date as JavaScript Date object, or Microsoft Rest Date Format in <span class="inlineCode">/Date(334343433)/</span> form or simple parsable Date format.</p>

    <p>
        Year drop down is loaded with range specified by startYear and endYear properties. Both these properties are relative to current Year and they are added to current Year and the range is loaded automatically. In above example, you can see that year starts 5 years back in the past till 20 years in the future. 
        Also note, in order to make things simpler, we have set values in curley braces, so values are recognized as proper javascript numbers.</p>
