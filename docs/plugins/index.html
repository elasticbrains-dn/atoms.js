    <h1>Atoms.js Plugins</h1>
    <p>
        Atoms.js is all about a UI component, and a plugin is an additional UI Component Library which you can use it on an Atom Application.</p>
    <p>
        We are shipping certain plugins by default with our library, however atoms.js do not include these plugins as they are little resource intensive and they need Flash fallback etc.</p>
    <h2>How to make Plugin?</h2>
    <p>
        Plugin is a simple UI component, and Atoms.js has specific life cycle events that plugin must program. Plugin can control one or more UI controls. Following guidelines must be used while creating plugins.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Plugin must and only contain UI Controls, other referenced JS files must be kept separate.</li>
        <li>Plugin must specify external JS/CSS references in documentation correctly along with their licenses.</li>
        <li>While encapsulating other JS library, plugin file name and UI control name should always begin with word &quot;Atom&quot;. For example VideoJS UI Control should be named as &quot;AtomVideoJS&quot; and file name should be &quot;atom-videojs&quot; or &quot;atom-video-js&quot;.</li>
        <li>README.md must be provided in the same folder, all necessary JS references should be kept in the same folder or child folder.</li>
    </ol>
