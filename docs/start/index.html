    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        Reader of this documentation is expected to have good knowledge about following.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5, JavaScript and CSS</li>
        <li>ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Web Forms or PHP or any other Server Side Programming capable of handling AJAX requests</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
        We did identify lots of concepts and have already seen various JavaScript libraries, but none of them fit our requirements. Larger business applications are programmed by many developers and many teams. Other platforms such as Flex and Silverlight offer a lot in terms of managing and maintaining code. Writing code and managing code are two different aspects. Abstractions and rewriting logic in the form of simpler blocks makes everyone’s life very easy. Our goal was to bring new concepts into HTML so that visualizing and maintaining code becomes easy.</p>
    <h2>Service Oriented Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        PHP, ASP, Razor are easier to write, but very difficult to maintain and visualize the logic as combinations of in line script operators. MVC architecture is good but when it comes to user interface, the final html code, it becomes messy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, it needs more round trip if user’s view needs changes. I am aware of partial views etc, but they are still messy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rich Internet Applications brought concept of delivering UI to the client independently of data and let the client request for the data needed from server side. So by either JSON or SOAP Web Service, data is sent to client and let client display, manage and play with it.</p>
