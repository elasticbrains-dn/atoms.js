    <h1>Element</h1>
    <p>
        Element refers to HTML Element such as div, a, ui, li etc. Elements occur in HTML Document as they are defined. However Atoms.js script removes every element and rearranges entire set by atom attributes.</p>
    <h2>Atom Type Attribute</h2>
    <p>
        Element remains simple HTML element and behaves as one till you apply <span class="inlineCode">atom-type</span> attribute or put it inside any other element that has <span class="inlineCode">atom-type</span> attribute.</p>
    <p>
        Once <span class="inlineCode">atom-type</span> attribute is applied, default behavior may no longer function because Atoms.js will change the behavior based on the type it is expected. For example, if you set atom-type as AtomButton on Anchor tag (a), then by clicking on a, it will simply act as a button but not navigate to anywhere even if href is defined.</p>
    <p>
        We have provided standard controls that may help in developing applications of almost any type.</p>
